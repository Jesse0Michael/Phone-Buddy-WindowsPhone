Hello! In case you were wondering why the project's name is Wuddo, it's because my fiance's nickname for her adorable dog is Buddo Wuddo. It stuck with me.


As of now, there is very limited functionality. Items on the to be implemented list are:
Create new dog image and animations for every possible activity.
Implement Tug-of-War mini-game.
Record sounds to put in the game.
Re-implement some elements so that the game will also work on Windows Phone 7.


Thanks You!
